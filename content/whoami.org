* the ∞-catgirl & witch apprentice
I'm currently a graduate student trying to work her way into homotopy theory and/or
algebraic K-theory. I enjoy reinterpreting and explaining well-known things,
as well as working towards the point where I'm able to produce something original.

* what's around?
some of the stuff I've worked on or am working on.
recreation math for sure, but hopefully also other random things.
